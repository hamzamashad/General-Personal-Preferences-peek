    <h3>Basketball, sadly as hobby</h3>
    <p>
        I stared playing basketball since I was a kid. It was kind of my whole focus until I started my bachelor's degree, where
        my focus was driven away a bit by bit due to many reasons. Now it's all but a hobby for me, which is sad.
        Here's a picture of me playing basketball back in 2020, before it all went downhill.</p>
